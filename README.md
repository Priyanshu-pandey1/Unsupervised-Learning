# 🔍 Unsupervised Learning: Clustering & Pattern Discovery

This repository documents my deep dive into **Unsupervised Learning**, focusing on identifying hidden structures and groupings within unlabeled data.

## 📅 Day 16: K-Means Clustering & Iris Analysis

Today, I kicked off my Unsupervised Learning chapter by mastering the fundamentals of centroid-based clustering.

### 1. K-Means Implementation
* **Concept:** Partitioning data into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters where each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
* **The Elbow Method:** Implemented a visualization of the 'Within-Cluster Sum of Squares' (WCSS) to mathematically determine the optimal number of clusters.
* **Iris Dataset:** Applied the algorithm to the classic Iris dataset to see how unsupervised clusters align with known species labels.
